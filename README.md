- 👋 Hi, I’m @lindseymazy, but you can call me Linds!
- 👀 I’m interested in reading books, going to the movies, cooking new recipes, checking out new bars or coffee shops (iced oat lattes / boba - yum), video games (like Final Fantasy), binging reality TV (like Amazing Race), finding new music, and getting tattoos (I currently have 5).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about marketing and exploring new trends in web3 and decentralization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve decentralization and/or gaming. 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I am half-Canadian on my mother's side but was raised in Texas. I currently live in Dallas with my partner and our two furry rugrats: Luna the dog and Traxx the cat. I am also a neurodivergent individual and proud of it!
